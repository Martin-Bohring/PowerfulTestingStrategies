### Powerful testing strategies

- Testing software is still a challenge
- Automatic testing even more so
- How can we be confident about the quality of our software?
- How can we ensure the long time quality of software?
- There are different views on testing with different goals
- There are different approaches to testing
- There are lots of tools for testing

### What are unit tests?

- Unit tests obviously tests units of software
- But what is a unit of software?
- Everybody knows the units of mass (ton, kg, etc.)
- but nobody has an exact definition of a software unit

> in order to determine whether a new feature or component works with
> (or integrates with) existing features and components.

*Integration tests* are used to prove that all software features and components work together.
